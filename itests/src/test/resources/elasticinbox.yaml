### Mailbox settings
# Mailbox quota can be set by total bytes and/or message count.
# To disable quota parameter set it to 0.
mailbox_quota_bytes: 1073741824
mailbox_quota_count: 50000

### Monitoring settings
# Enabling performance counters will allow monitoring of various stats
# (e.g. LMTP, Hector) through the JMX interface.
#
# Stats are collected and aggregated for the given interval (in seconds).
enable_performance_counters: true
performance_counters_interval: 180

### LMTP daemon settings
# Set port number and maximum concurrent connections.
lmtp_port: 2400
lmtp_max_connections: 20
# if enabled, messages received via LMTP will be available from POP3
lmtp_enable_pop3: true

### POP3 settings
# Set port number and maximum concurrent connections.
pop3_port: 2110
pop3_max_connections: 20

### Database settings
# Database used for storing metadata of accounts, labels and messages.
# Optionally, it is possible to store blobs in the database (see database_blob_max_threshold).  
# Currently only "cassandra" is supported.
database_driver: cassandra

# If you want to store parsed HTML and/or PLAIN text of the message body
# in the metadata storage, enable below.
#
# Note: When no HTML message body available in HTML store mode, ElasticInbox
# will automatically fallback to PLAIN text mode and store available PLAIN text.  
store_html_message: true
store_plain_message: false

# Maximum blob size in bytes which can be stored in the database.
# Blobs larger than this value will be stored with the deafult blob profile (blobstore_write_profile).
# If compression enabled, this threshold will be applied to a compressed blob size.
# Set to 0 to disable using database as a blob storage. Maximum allowed value 128K.
database_blob_max_size: 32768

### Cassandra settings
# Specify Cassandra hosts (multiple for LB), cluster name, keyspace
# and auto discovery

### Blob storage settings
#
# Following public and private blob store providers are supported:
#            aws-s3, cloudfiles-us, cloudfiles-uk, filesystem,
#            azureblob, atmos (generic), synaptic-storage, scaleup-storage,
#            cloudonestorage, walrus(generic), googlestorage, ninefold-storage,
#            scality-rs2 (generic), hosteurope-storage, tiscali-storage,
#            eucalyptus-partnercloud-s3, swift (generic)
#
# IMPORTANT: Blob store profile names should never be changed and should be
#            identical on all ElasticInbox nodes. Profile names are stored in
#            metadata. ElasticInbox does not verify profile configurations.
